Doing this method would help ensure that the documetation is up to date since it takes out the need to pull changes from the repo to a desktop environment.

Using Github: Pages would be publicly visible unless NC account has team subscription ($4/mo from my short research). Minimal time to convert.

Using self hosted: Everything would stay in house and not rely on an outside source.
